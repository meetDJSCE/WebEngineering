        <p>
            C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C <br>
            language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system
            or <br> compiler development.

        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>
            Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years. Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as if provides support
            for <br>primitive data types (like int, char, etc.) The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) <br>
            regardless of the underlying architecture.
